<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Family search is an amazing tool to find more about yourself. The main problem is that you can only load one image, if you are looking for your old relatives, maybe you will have to look for thousands of files to find a birth certificate.
This code just helps you to load all the images faster.
IMPORTANT: You shouldn't use the download function, Family Search can identify you as a robot if you are using this function.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
